# Configuration & setup

Everything that controls how OpenKB talks to your LLM lives in two places:
`.openkb/config.yaml` (model, language, tuning) and a `.env` file (your API key).

---

## Install

```bash
pip install openkb
```

OpenKB pins a **pre-release** of its PageIndex dependency
(`pageindex==0.3.0.dev3`), which some installers skip by default. If an install
can't resolve `pageindex`, allow pre-releases:

```bash
uv tool install openkb --prerelease=allow   # uv
pip install --pre openkb                     # pip
```

If `openkb` isn't found *after* a successful install, the console-script directory
isn't on your `PATH` (e.g. `pip --user` installs to `~/.local/bin`) — add it to
`PATH`.

---

## 1. Initialize a knowledge base

```bash
mkdir my-kb && cd my-kb
openkb init
```

`init` is interactive in a terminal and prompts for three things:

- **Model** — in LiteLLM `provider/model` format. OpenAI models can drop the
  prefix (`gpt-5.4`); others need it (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`,
  `gemini/gemini-3-flash-preview`).
- **LLM API key** — hidden input; if you provide one it's written to `.env` with
  `0600` permissions. Press Enter to skip and set it later.
- **Language** — the output language for your wiki. Any language works; e.g. the
  six official UN languages: `en` (English), `zh` (Chinese), `es` (Spanish),
  `fr` (French), `ar` (Arabic), `ru` (Russian).

Skip the prompts entirely with flags — handy in scripts:

```bash
openkb init --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 --language en
openkb init -m gpt-5.4 -l zh
```

> **Non-interactive (pipes/CI):** prompts are gated on a TTY. When stdin isn't a
> terminal, `init` uses the defaults instead of hanging, so
> `printf 'gpt-5.4\n\nen\n' | openkb init` works in a script.

`init` creates: `raw/`, `wiki/{summaries,concepts,entities,sources/images}`,
`wiki/AGENTS.md`, `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, and `.openkb/config.yaml`.

---

## 2. `.openkb/config.yaml` reference

The file `init` writes is small; everything else is optional. This is the shipped
[`config.yaml.example`](../../config.yaml.example), verbatim:

```yaml
model: gpt-5.4                   # LLM model (any LiteLLM-supported provider)
language: en                     # Wiki output language
pageindex_threshold: 20          # PDF pages threshold for PageIndex

# Optional: cap concurrent LLM calls during ingest (PageIndex indexing and
# concept/entity compilation — they never overlap, so one setting covers
# both). Lower it if you hit provider rate limits or "too many open files" on
# large PDFs. Omit to let each stage apply its own default.
# concurrency: 5

# Optional: whether the LLM agents (query, chat, lint, skill) may call tools
# in parallel. Leave it UNSET (commented out) to keep OpenKB's per-agent
# defaults. Setting it applies the SAME value to every agent:
#   true    allow parallel tool calls
#   false   force sequential tool calls
#   null    don't send the setting at all (use the provider default) — REQUIRED
#           for Amazon Bedrock Claude, which rejects the request when
#           parallel_tool_calls is sent at all (any value). See #175.
# parallel_tool_calls: null

# Optional: override the entity-type vocabulary used for entity pages.
# Omit this key to use the default 7 types
# (person, organization, place, product, work, event, other).
# entity_types:
#   - person
#   - organization
#   - dataset
#   - model

# Optional: LLM / LiteLLM tuning. Keys are forwarded to LiteLLM; `timeout` and
# `extra_headers` apply per request, the rest are set as litellm.<key>.
# litellm:
#   timeout: 1200          # per-request timeout (s); raise for slow local backends (Ollama)
#   drop_params: true      # let LiteLLM drop params a provider rejects (e.g. Ollama)
#   num_retries: 3
#   extra_headers:         # extra HTTP headers some providers need (e.g. GitHub Copilot)
#     Editor-Version: vscode/1.95.0
#     Copilot-Integration-Id: vscode-chat
```

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | `gpt-5.4` | LLM used for all compile/query/chat work. |
| `language` | `en` | Language the wiki is written in. |
| `pageindex_threshold` | `20` | PDFs with this many pages **or more** take the long-doc (PageIndex) path; shorter ones go through the short-doc path. See [`pageindex-cloud/`](../pageindex-cloud/). |
| `concurrency` | `null` | Caps concurrent LLM calls OpenKB makes during ingest — both PageIndex's indexing of a long document and OpenKB's own concept/entity compilation. The two never run at once for the same document, so one setting covers both. Lower it if you hit provider rate limits or "too many open files" on large PDFs. `null` lets each stage apply its own default. |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | unset | Whether the LLM agents (query, chat, lint, skill) may call tools in parallel. Unset keeps OpenKB's per-agent defaults; `true`/`false` force allow/sequential for every agent; `null` omits the setting (provider default). **Amazon Bedrock needs `null`** (see below). |
| `entity_types` | 7 defaults | Custom vocabulary for entity pages. `other` is always kept. |
| `litellm:` | – | A pass-through block for LiteLLM. See below. |

### The `litellm:` block

OpenKB forwards this block to LiteLLM so you can tune anything LiteLLM supports —
you set it, LiteLLM uses it. Two keys are special:

- `timeout` and `extra_headers` are applied **per request** (they're needed on
  every call).
- Every other key (`drop_params`, `num_retries`, `ssl_verify`, …) is set on the
  `litellm` module as a process-wide global.

#### Slow local runtimes (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp)

Local inference can be slow — on a Mac running **LM Studio**, a single compile
call can take minutes, and the **default request timeout will abort it** (this is
the usual cause of failures with local runtimes). Raise `timeout` (in seconds).
Add `drop_params` for backends that reject OpenAI-only params (e.g. Ollama):

```yaml
model: ollama/llama3.1     # or your LM Studio / llama.cpp model id
language: en
litellm:
  drop_params: true
  timeout: 1200            # raise further (e.g. 3600) for large local models
```

#### GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT-subscription providers

These need extra headers and use OAuth (no API key):

```yaml
model: github_copilot/gpt-4o
language: en
litellm:
  extra_headers:
    Editor-Version: vscode/1.95.0
    Copilot-Integration-Id: vscode-chat
```

#### OpenRouter response caching

When your `model` is an `openrouter/*` model, you can opt into OpenRouter's
[Response Caching](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/response-caching):
identical-payload requests come back in ~80–300 ms with **zero token billing**.
That's a direct win on the compile-retry path (a failed `add` re-runs every
summary/plan/concept call with the same prompts) and on repeated `lint` / dev
iteration. Send the cache headers via `extra_headers`:

```yaml
model: openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
language: en
extra_headers:                  # top-level, or nested under `litellm:` — both work
  X-OpenRouter-Cache: "true"
  X-OpenRouter-Cache-TTL: "600" # optional, 1–86400s (OpenRouter default 300)
```

It's opt-in by design: responses are stored on OpenRouter, so leave it off for
zero-data-retention / regulated content. Only `openrouter/*` models read these
headers; other providers ignore them.

---

## 3. API keys & providers

Set one universal key and OpenKB routes it to the right provider based on your
`model`. The shipped [`.env.example`](../../.env.example):

```bash
# OpenAI:    LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
# Anthropic: LLM_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Gemini:    LLM_API_KEY=AIza...
LLM_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

- **Provider auto-detection:** `model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` → your
  `LLM_API_KEY` is exported as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` automatically.
- **OAuth providers** (`chatgpt/*`, `github_copilot/*`) need **no** key — OpenKB
  won't warn about a missing one.
- **PageIndex Cloud** uses a separate `PAGEINDEX_API_KEY` (see
  [`pageindex-cloud/`](../pageindex-cloud/)).
- **Amazon Bedrock** (`model: bedrock/...`) authenticates with AWS credentials,
  not `LLM_API_KEY`. Put them in `<kb>/.env` (LiteLLM/boto3 read them from the
  environment); `LLM_API_KEY` isn't needed:

  ```bash
  # <kb>/.env
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
  AWS_REGION_NAME=eu-central-1
  ```

  ```yaml
  # <kb>/.openkb/config.yaml
  model: bedrock/eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6
  parallel_tool_calls: null   # REQUIRED for Bedrock Claude: sending
                              # parallel_tool_calls at all (any value) makes
                              # LiteLLM send a malformed tool_choice that Bedrock
                              # rejects (#175). null tells OpenKB to omit it.
                              # Write it as bare `null` — not `None` or "null".
  ```

**Where keys are read from** (first match wins, existing env always respected):

1. your shell environment
2. `<kb>/.env`
3. `~/.config/openkb/.env` (a global key shared across all your KBs)

---

## 4. Where is "the KB"?

Most commands need to know which KB they act on. Resolution order:

1. `--kb-dir /path/to/kb` (or `OPENKB_DIR=/path/to/kb`) — explicit override.
2. Walk up from the current directory looking for a `.openkb/` folder.
3. The global default registered by `openkb use <path>` (stored in
   `~/.config/openkb/global.yaml`).

```bash
# Run a query against a specific KB from anywhere
openkb --kb-dir ~/research-kb query "what changed in v2?"

# Make one KB the default, then forget about paths
openkb use ~/research-kb
openkb status        # now resolves ~/research-kb from any directory
```

Next: [`commands/`](../commands/) — the everyday ingest-and-query loop.
